Jang & Barnett (1994) examined the impact of national culture on organizational culture by analyzing messages directed to external audiences. For a total of 35 Japanese and American businesses, annual reports for 1992 were analyzed by determining the most frequently used words in all 35 reports. Then, the frequency of each word for each company was determined.
There are different packages in R that can do MDS. But they use different algorithms. We use the SmacofSym package. It can both do metric (type=interval) and non-metric MDS (type = ordinal) and gives the stress values. Here we choose metric multidimensional scaling.
To illustrate the use of multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis we first work with a distance matrix that measures the distances between.
``` {r}
#Installing packages smacof for multidimensional scaling plot
#install.packages("smacof")
library(smacof)
#read in matrix csv-file
Jang_Barnett <- read.csv2("Data/Jang_Barnett.csv", header=TRUE,row.names = 1)
class(Jang_Barnett)
Jang_Barnett
#Pre-processing
Jang_Barnett.C1 <- as.matrix(Jang_Barnett) #Convert to matrix
Jang_Barnett.C2 <- t(Jang_Barnett.C1)%*%Jang_Barnett.C1 #Transpose matrix
distance_matrix_JB <- dist(Jang_Barnett.C2, method = "euclidean") #Create a distance matrix
class(Jang_Barnett.C2)

#A one-mode matrix of the American and Japanese companies
Jang_Barnett.C2
#Calculate dissimilarity matrix
#dissimilarity <- dist(Jang_Barnett.C2, method = "euclidean")
#Perform cluster analysis
fit.cluster <- hclust(dissimilarity, method = "ward.D")
#Plot results of Cluster Analysis
plot(fit.cluster, main = "Cluster Analysis Results") + theme( axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
#Perform multidimensional scaling
fit.multi <- cmdscale(dissimilarity, k = 2)
#Plot results of Multidimensional Scaling
plot(fit.multi[, 1], fit.multi[, 2], main = "Multidimensional Scaling Results", xlab = "dimension 1", ylab = "dimension 2")
#Plot a Multidimensional Scaling with an ordinal type through smacof in order to retrieve a cluster between the different companies
MDS_Companies <- smacofSym(Jang_Barnett.C2, type = "ordinal", ndim=2)
MDS_Companies$stress
plot(MDS_Companies)
